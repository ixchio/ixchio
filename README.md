# IXCHIO

**Final year CS student. Part-time AI Engineer.**  
*Building production systems that serve 1000+ users daily.*

*I don't write code to pad my resume. I write it because someone's business depends on it working at 3 AM.*

## What I've Shipped

**Safe Agent Sandbox Runtime** → [aum.sitrai.com](https://aum.sitrai.com)  
Autonomous AI agents executing code safely. 1000+ daily runs, 99.9% uptime. Multi-provider LLM fallback (OpenAI → Claude → Ollama). Cut costs by $400/month, reduced failures 60%.

**Groq Coder** → [groq-coder.vercel.app](https://groq-coder.vercel.app)  
Production AI code generation with real-time streaming and multi-stage validation. Built it. Deployed it. Users love it.

**AutoPR-AI** → [github.com/ixchio/autopr-ai](https://github.com/ixchio/autopr-ai)  
Autonomous code description pipeline with evaluation microservice comparing Llama/Mistral/GPT performance.

**Open Source**  
- OpenHands: 4 merged PRs, built eval harness (35% cost reduction, 3x throughput)  
- LangChain: PR #31327, multi-agent orchestration improvements

## Stack I Ship With

**AI/ML**: Agent systems, LLM orchestration (GPT/Claude/Llama), prompt engineering, evaluation pipelines, production LLM ops  
**Backend**: Python (expert), FastAPI, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery  
**Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes/EKS, AWS (EC2, S3), CI/CD  
**Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Weights & Biases

*Zero Kubernetes knowledge → production EKS deployment in one week. That's how I work.*

## What Makes Me Different

Most students build side projects. I build systems that handle real traffic, real money, real consequences.

- Deployed production code while 30 other developers watched me debug their "impossible" issue
- Contributed to OpenHands and LangChain while they weren't hiring interns
- Run 1000+ autonomous agent executions daily without waking up to fire alarms
- Know the difference between "demo works" and "production ready"

I've debugged race conditions at 2 AM, optimized LLM costs while maintaining quality, and built monitoring dashboards before things broke. 

Not because a bootcamp told me to. Because production systems don't care about your feelings.

## What I'm Looking For

Graduating May 2026. Available immediately after.

**Target**: Founding engineer / AI engineer roles where I'm building 0→1, not maintaining legacy code.

**What I bring**:
- Production AI systems experience, not just tutorials
- Startup velocity - ship fast, iterate faster, own outcomes
- End-to-end ownership - from architecture to monitoring
- Open source contributor mindset
- Comfortable with ambiguity and unclear specs

**What I need**:
- High ownership, low bureaucracy
- Team that values shipping over meetings
- Problems that matter

Current CTC: ₹11 LPA | Expected: ₹18-25 LPA | Open to remote + relocation

## Let's Build

If you're solving hard problems and need someone who ships, not someone who talks about shipping:
